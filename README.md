This is for an assignment from the machine learning course, part of the MSc Voice Technology, 2023-2024, at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG). The project develops a logistic regression classifier to determine the quality of posts in a community forum, labeling them as "good" or "bad." The classifier uses a dataset provided in CSV format with features like number of words, misspellings, punctuation, and sentence structure, aimed at reflecting post quality.
